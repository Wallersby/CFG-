About me

Iâ€™ve been a carpenter for all of my working life and have specialised in constructing loft conversions for over 25 years and running my company for roughly 20 years. I cover Plymouth and the surrounding area.

We are a small friendly (animal loving) team; currently me and my apprentice Bailey. 

I can carry out a full conversion; beginning with the design and planning, through to the last lick of paint or a structure only conversion, which enables the customer to finish the interior fitting at their own leisure.
