FAQS

How much does a loft conversion cost?

There is no simple answer as it depends on a lot of variables, including how big your property is, how high end the fixtures and fittings you choose are and whether you choose to have a dormer.  The cost of materials has also been highly variable in recent years. As a rough guide a basic conversion, in a medium sized property, with a dormer may start at around Â£40,000.

Will it be messy?

You may be surprised at how little mess a loft conversion creates, when carried out by a good company.  We lay dust sheets over your stair, hall and landing carpets and also vacuum up after ourselves at the end of each day.

What should I consider when considering a loft conversion?

There are many things to consider when planning a loft.  We can support and advise you:
Is your loft appropriate to be converted? If you have a very low pitched roof or low head height, it may not be appropriate
Should you pay for a dormer? A dormer is more expensive, but adds more full height space and significantly adds to your usable space
How you will use your new space and how does it fit into your existing rooms.  
Where could the stairs leading up to the loft fit into your existing layout?
Is there a nice view that you can maximise with big windows or a Juliet balcony?
Do you want a shower room in your loft space?
Will you have one main room or more than one?
You need a party wall act agreement with your neighbours if you have a semi-detached or terraced property
Most loft conversions don't need planning permission, but some do.
